We learn by doing, not viewing. The Learning Design of @pythonfab is based on learning science principles. 



The concepts in each unit will be presented in short explantory videos and accompanying text. Each video will be no longer than five minutes.

The concepts in each unit will be reinforced by practice exercises in Coding Rooms. Most will be graded automatically for quick feedback. Some will be graded by an instructor.

Live interactive sessions are meant to reinforce active learning. They are designed as live coding sessions, usually at the beginning or end of a unit.

Learning complex skills is inherently a team activity. Collaborative coding challenges is meant to develop complex problem solving skills in a group setting.
