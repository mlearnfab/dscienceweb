## <font color="blue">Major Units</font>


- **Unit 0: Orientation:** In the orientation session we will go over the curriculum and expectations. There is also a brief introduction to the main concepts of programming. You will also write several elementary programs in Python.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 1: Getting Started:** In Unit 1 we will introduce the programming environment and the tools you will be using during the course of study. Think of yourself as an athlete in training. Your goal in the first few weeks is to establish a routine and a good set of habits. You should be "training" on average a couple of hours each week.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 2: Simple Data Types and Operations.** In Unit 2 we introduce Python simple data types and operations. The simple data types include *int*, *float*, *string*, and *boolean*. We can think of the data types as the atoms of the Python language. We also introduce a number of useful Python functions.

- **Unit 3: String Methods.** In Unit 3 we study a variety of string methods. In the unit we will introduce concepts that are also critical to the study of collections. As we spend time on strings, we will briefly explore some basic concepts in Natural Language Processing. 


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 4: Collections and Operations.** In Unit 4 we study the principal collections in Python: *lists*, *tuples*, *sets*, and *dictionaries*. 


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 5: Iteration.** In Unit 5 we introduce Iteration with the use of *for* and *while* loops. Repetition is boring for humans. Computers excel at repetition. Harnessing this ability is a key to computation. 


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 6: Branching.** In Unit 6 we study various techniques for branching through statements, such as if .. else. A computer program is a series of instructions. But most programs are not strictly sequential. Depending on a state or condition, the path of execution will vary.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 7: Functions.** In Unit 7 we introduce Python functions. Functions allow for reuse of code. But they are also a powerful tool for generalization and abstraction. In your study of Python, you will be writing your own functions but also accessing the rich array of functions in the Python standard and extended libraries.
