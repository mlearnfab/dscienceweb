## <font color="blue">Major Units</font>


- **Unit 0: Orientation:** In the orientation session we will go over the curriculum and expectations. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 1: Getting Started:** In Unit 1 we will introduce the Jupyter notebook environment and the tools you will be using during the course of study. 


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 2: Pandas Objects.** In Unit 2 we introduce the "workhorse" data structure for data science in Python: the Pandas dataframe and Pandas series.



<p>&nbsp;</p>



- **Unit 3: Data Transformation.** In Unit 3 we will look at common data transformation on the Pandas dataframe. Borrowing the vocabulary of R's dplyr, the data transformations are: select, filter, arrange, mutate, and summarize.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 4: Data Visualization.** In Unit 4 we introduce the two principal libraries for data visualization in Python: matplotlib and seaborn.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 5: Missing Data.** In Unit 5 we introduce techniques for identifying and treating missing data.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 6: Data Aggregation.** In Unit 6 we study various techniques for aggregating and summarizing data. The techniques include groupby, pivot tables, and hierarchical indexing.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 7: Descriptive Statistics.** In Unit 7 we turn to statistics, opening the door to an essential set of methodologies in data science.
