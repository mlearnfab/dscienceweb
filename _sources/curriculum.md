- **Unit 5: Exploratory Data Analysis I.**  In Unit 5 we will put together techniques learned thus far towards analyzing data sets.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 6: Math Review** In Unit 6 we will review some foundational mathematical concepts as they apply to data science.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 7:Exploratory Data Analysis II** In Unit 7 we will deepen our understanding of EDA techniques.
